            <p class="p1">Travel exposes us to different cultures and ancient traditions and through these authentic encounters, we learn to embrace and celebrate both our similarities and our differences. Travel teaches us about humanity and gives us an appreciation, understanding and respect for different points of view and ways of life.</p>

            <h4>A thousand lights</h4>
            <p class="p1">A 24 year old had made his way to the tower of Lupin. He climbed
                a thousand steps on his way to the top each with an LED light matching
                the number of the step. As he reached a thousand he gazed through a glass window to see a thousand more.

            <h4>A road trip with a resilient mouse</h4>
            <p class="p1">
                The mice follow me where I go. So I lay traps on every path and road. I plan for this on every journey but one mouse remains but make no mistake this mouse is no nuisance. Infact it is in part a source of my sustenace for without it I can not type read or write all that si wriiten on my hard drive.
